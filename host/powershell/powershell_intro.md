# Introduction to PowerShell

## Why are we learning about PowerShell again?

- **Low impact**
    - Native to Windows ‚Äì no install required.
    - Do not need to touch the disk (much).
- **Faster than Command Prompt**
- **Can be used for automation**
- **One of the few tools we have available to "hunt" during DCI.**

## Upgrading Commands

One of the most important skills when hunting with PowerShell is learning how to **upgrade** basic commands into more powerful pipelines.

We‚Äôll use **process hunting** as our example.
### Start simple

See everything that‚Äôs running.

`Get-Process`
### Refine

Only show the fields you care about.

`Get-Process | Select-Object Name, Id, Path`

### Filter

Look only for a specific process, like PowerShell.

`Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.Name -like "powershell*" }`

### Sort / Limit

Find the top 5 memory-hungry processes.

`Get-Process | Sort-Object WorkingSet -Descending | Select-Object -First 5 Name, Id, WorkingSet`

### Export

Save results for later analysis.

`Get-Process | Select-Object Name, Id, Path, CPU |   Export-Csv -Path .\process_list.csv -NoTypeInformation`

Export as JSON (useful for scripts/automation):

`Get-Process | Select-Object Name, Id, Path |   ConvertTo-Json | Out-File .\process_list.json`

# Hunting with PowerShell

## Basic Hunting

- System Information
- User Accounts
- Processes
- Services
- Network Information
- Persistence
- File Info
- Installed Programs
- Event Logs
- Execution Artefacts


---

## System Information

### Scenario

You've been asked to perform a hunt on a Windows Network.  
You (Host Analyst) have been tasked with performing a baseline of the network.  
This requires you to confirm all the host names and their versions of Windows.

### Answers

**Basic:**

```powershell
systeminfo
```

```powershell
hostname
```

**Upgraded:**

```powershell
Get-ComputerInfo | Select-Object CsName, WindowsProductName, WindowsVersion, OsHardwareAbstractionLayer
```

---

## üë§ User Accounts

### Scenario

It's five days into the hunt, someone reports a user performing suspicious activity. You check the baseline and see that the user account was present during the baseline. This doesn't mean that the user account is clear.

The account is a domain account.

### Answers

**Basic:**

```powershell
net user <username> /domain
```

**Upgraded:**

```powershell
Get-ADUser <username> -Properties MemberOf | Select-Object SamAccountName, MemberOf
```

```powershell
Get-ADUser <username> -Properties LastLogonDate | Select-Object SamAccountName, LastLogonDate
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Processes & Services

### Scenario

You see PowerShell.exe running on a host but are unsure if it's normal for that process to be running.

List all running processes.  
Check process metadata including paths and arguments.

**Questions to ask yourself:**

- Does it make sense for PowerShell to be running?
    
- Is it explainable?
    

### Answers

**Basic:**

```powershell
Get-Process
```

```powershell
Get-Process powershell
```

**Upgraded:**  
Path to executable:

```powershell
Get-Process powershell | Select-Object Id, Path
```

Command line:

```powershell
Get-WmiObject Win32_Process -Filter "Name='powershell.exe'" |
  Select-Object ProcessId, ExecutablePath, CommandLine
```

Parent Process:

```powershell
Get-CimInstance Win32_Process -Filter "Name='powershell.exe'" |
  Select-Object ProcessId, ParentProcessId, CommandLine
```

---

## üåê Network & Remote Connections

### Scenario

A network analyst has asked you to confirm that the network traffic they're seeing is coming from the host you're looking at, and if there's anything that could be causing that traffic (e.g., malicious process).

### Answers

**Basic:**

```cmd
netstat -ano
```

```cmd
netstat -bano
```

**Upgraded:**

```powershell
Get-NetTCPConnection -State Established |
  Select-Object LocalAddress, LocalPort, RemoteAddress, RemotePort, OwningProcess
```

---

## üîí Persistence

### Scenario

Your team located some malware and are devising a remediation plan.  
You need to make sure you remove all the persistence mechanisms for the malware.

### Answers

**Basic:**

```cmd
reg query HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
reg query HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
reg query HKLM\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
```

```cmd
schtasks /query /fo LIST /v
```

**Upgraded:**

```powershell
Get-ScheduledTask | Select-Object TaskName, TaskPath, State
```

---

## üìÇ File System

### Scenario

During your hunt, you want to check for suspicious files that may have been dropped by malware, scripts used for persistence, or tools staged by an attacker.

### Answers

**Basic:**

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\AppData" -Recurse -File | Select-Object FullName

```

**Upgraded:**  
Find recently created files (last 7 days):

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Users\ -Recurse -File |
  Where-Object { $_.CreationTime -gt (Get-Date).AddDays(-7) } |
  Select-Object FullName, CreationTime
```

Find executables/scripts in unusual locations:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Users\ -Recurse -Include *.exe,*.dll,*.bat,*.ps1 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

---

## Installed Programs
### Scenario

You want to confirm what software is installed on a host to look for potentially unwanted or malicious programs.

### Answers

**Basic:**

`Get-WmiObject Win32_Product`

**Upgraded (faster, cleaner):**

`Get-ItemProperty HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\* |   Select-Object DisplayName, DisplayVersion, Publisher, InstallDate`


---

## Event Logs

### Scenario

You suspect suspicious logon activity and want to check the **Security** event logs for evidence.

### Answers

**Basic:**

`Get-EventLog -LogName Security`

**Upgraded (logon events only):**

`Get-EventLog -LogName Security -InstanceId 4624 -Newest 10 |   Select-Object TimeGenerated, ReplacementStrings`

**Upgraded (filter with Get-WinEvent):**

`Get-WinEvent -LogName Security -FilterHashtable @{Id=4624} |   Select-Object TimeCreated, Id, Message -First 20`

---

## Execution Artefacts

### Scenario

You want to see what has been executed on the host to look for suspicious commands or programs.

### Answers

**Basic (Prefetch ‚Äî requires admin):**

`Get-ChildItem C:\Windows\Prefetch`

**Upgraded (show file names + creation time):**

`Get-ChildItem C:\Windows\Prefetch |   Select-Object Name, CreationTime, LastWriteTime`

**Upgraded (ShimCache / AppCompatCache ‚Äî from registry):**

`Get-ItemProperty HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\AppCompatCache`

# PowerShell Remoting

## ** NEED TO USE RANGE**

# PowerShell Scripting

### Learning Objectives

- Understand how simple PowerShell scripts can be used for **live hunting** and reconnaissance in restricted environments.
    
- Practice core scripting concepts: **variables, loops, conditionals, objects, and exporting**.
    
- Build a lightweight, readable **ping-sweep tool** that can be extended for simple port checks and live triage.
    

### Prerequisites & Materials

- Lab VM or workstation with PowerShell (Windows 10/11). Administrator rights recommended for full functionality.
    
- Text editor (Notepad, VS Code) and access to a classroom network or isolated lab subnet (e.g., 192.168.56.0/24 or 10.1.21.0/24).
    
- All activities should be run in an isolated lab environment ‚Äî do **not** run network scans on production networks without permission.
    

### Teaching Flow

1. **Introduce** the difference between hunting and forensics (5 min).
    
2. **Demonstrate** each code block live, explaining the concept (30‚Äì45 min).
    
3. **Hands-on**: students build and run the script in small groups (30‚Äì45 min).
    
4. **Triage demo**: instructor walks through an alert generated by the script and maps it to ATT&CK techniques (15 min).
    

### Assessment / Deliverables

- Students should submit the final script (`ping_sweep.ps1`) and a short triage note describing one interesting host they found (IP, why suspicious, next steps).
    

---

## Step 1: Variables & Loops

```powershell
# Define network prefix
$network = "192.168.1"

# Sweep hosts 1‚Äì20
foreach ($i in 1..20) {
    $ip = "$network.$i"
    Write-Host "Pinging $ip..."
}
```

üëâ Students learn how to use **variables** and the `foreach` loop.

**Mini-Activity:** Change the subnet to match your lab (e.g., 10.1.21.x).

---

## Step 2: Adding a Ping Test

```powershell
foreach ($i in 1..20) {
    $ip = "$network.$i"
    if (Test-Connection -ComputerName $ip -Count 1 -Quiet) {
        Write-Host "$ip is UP"
    } else {
        Write-Host "$ip is DOWN"
    }
}
```

üëâ Introduces **conditionals** and `Test-Connection`. Students see live results.

**Mini-Activity:** Adjust the range to scan only 5 hosts.

---

## Step 3: Collecting Results into Objects

```powershell
$results = @()
foreach ($i in 1..20) {
    $ip = "$network.$i"
    $status = if (Test-Connection -ComputerName $ip -Count 1 -Quiet) {"UP"} else {"DOWN"}
    $results += [PSCustomObject]@{IP=$ip; Status=$status}
}
$results
```

üëâ Students create **structured data** instead of plain output.

**Mini-Activity:** Filter the `$results` object to only show UP hosts.

---

## Step 4: Exporting Results

```powershell
$results | Export-Csv -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\Desktop\ping_sweep.csv" -NoTypeInformation
```

üëâ Students learn how to **persist findings** into a CSV.

**Mini-Activity:** Open the CSV and confirm results.

---

## Step 5: Optional Port Checking

```powershell
foreach ($host in $results | Where-Object {$_.Status -eq "UP"}) {
    $ip = $host.IP
    $tcp = Test-NetConnection -ComputerName $ip -Port 445 -InformationLevel Quiet
    if ($tcp) { Write-Host "$ip has port 445 OPEN" }
}
```

üëâ Extends functionality by checking SMB (445) or RDP (3389).

**Mini-Activity:** Modify to check a different port of your choice.

---

## Capstone: Assemble the Full Script

Students now:

- Define a subnet
    
- Loop through a range of IPs
    
- Ping each host and log results
    
- Store results in objects
    
- Export results to CSV
    
- (Optional) Run port checks
    

üëâ At the end, they should have a script that looks and feels like a lightweight hunting tool, built piece by piece.

---

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lab, students will:

- Use **variables**, **loops**, and **if-else conditionals**
    
- Work with **PowerShell objects**
    
- Export results to **CSV**
    
- See how scripts can directly support live hunting when external tools are restricted
